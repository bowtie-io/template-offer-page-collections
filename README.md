# Offer Page - Collections Template

'Offer Page - Collections' is a Groupon Clone (daily deal style) Jeykll template designed for use with the BowTie collection editor. Payments are collected using [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/checkout) in conjunction with [BowTie.io](https://bowtie.io) product records.

Content in this template is editable via the [BowTie Collection Editor](https://bowtie.io/help/working-with-jekyll-collections-bowtie/), and meant as a learning resource. It is compatible with other BowTie components and templates, and the BowTie test environment.

This template includes components to build 'deals' from a Jekyll collection (offers), Stripe checkout buttons, countdown timer, authorship, category sorting, [disqus](https://disqus.com/) commenting, [addthis](http://www.addthis.com/) social sharing, error pages, a maintenance page, terms of service generation, post archives, Google maps, and user management and registration provided by BowTie.

The theme uses [jquery](https://jquery.com/), [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [fontawesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), and a custom theme styles written in [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/).
